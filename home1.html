<h2><font face="arial" color="black" size="5">
I am Bai Hanan U. Mama 16 years of age. I'm a grade 11 student and Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is my strand.<br> </br>

I'm a senior high school supposed to be a college student not until the system has changed. I'm currently studying at Notre Dame RVM College of Cotabato (NDRVMCC) <br> </br>

I want to achieve all my dreams in life and Nursing is the professionalism I want to pursue. Like every son and daughter I also want to return all the burden of my parents because for me it's a responsibility that need to be work for. <br> </br>

I have long curly hair but because I am wearing hijab or a head scarf my hair can't be seen publicly. <br> </br> I'm a proud Muslim since birth and Islam is my religion.

I'm aware of my religion and its rules that every Muslim believer should be responsible to it, but like the others I am not perfect.

I believe in the sayings that "My religion is perfect and I am not" so judge the person but not the religion.<br> </br>

I am jolly whenever I'm with my friends but I'm actually just a quite person who loves a quite and peaceful environment that's why I love nature. I really enjoy my own company because after all I only have myself.

<br> I really believe it myself and with that I only put my trust in Allah/God.</br> </h2> </center>
